## About the Game
Acquire is board game centered around the forming of corporations and buying of stocks in said corporations.
Players compete to see who can have the most money (both in cash and in assets) at the end of the game. Players
will work to become stock holders in large corporations and show who can become the biggest business mogul.

## Using this program
From the terminal, users can run this program from terminal with the gradle command run.  This will bring up
a start menu for which the user can choose to make a new game, load a previous game or exit.  If new game is
chosen, the user can choose the number of players who wish to play.  They may also check the advanced mode box
to remove any hints or ability to peak at other players stock holdings. Once the game is started, play starts
from player 1 and game play is similar to how the board game "Acquire" plays.  Once the end game criteria 
has been met, players can choose to end the game and the program will tally up the players money from their
wallet and stock holdings and tell the players who won.
